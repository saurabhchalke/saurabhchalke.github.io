        Welcome to Saurabh Chalke's home on the internet!<br /><br />I'm a fervent cypherpunk who once danced with the wolves of Wall Street at Morgan Stanley. Now, as the Founder of <a href="https://digitaldefensecompany.github.io/" target="_blank"><strong>The Digital Defense Company</strong></a>, I'm channeling my passion into pushing the boundaries of the zero-knowledge domain. Beyond the buzzwords, my heart beats for cryptography, the elegance of mathematics, the vast expanse of distributed systems, and the vivid wonders of computer graphics. When I'm not crafting zk-proofs or pondering over algorithms, I lose myself in mathematical riddles and computing visions. Dive into my world, where privacy meets possibility, and every challenge is just a cipher away from a solution!
