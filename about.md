        Welcome to Saurabh Chalke's home on the internet!<br /><br />I'm a fervent cypherpunk who once danced with the wolves of Wall Street at Morgan Stanley. Now, as the Founder of <a href="https://glamr.xyz/" target="_blank"><strong>Glamr</strong></a>, I'm channeling my passion into creating immersive AI companions in a stunning cyberpunk world. Beyond the buzzwords, my heart beats for cryptography, the elegance of mathematics, the vast expanse of distributed systems, and the vivid wonders of computer graphics. When I'm not crafting VR experiences or pondering over algorithms, I lose myself in mathematical riddles and computing visions. Dive into my world, where privacy meets possibility, and every challenge is just a cipher away from a solution!
