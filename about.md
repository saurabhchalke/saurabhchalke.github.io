        Welcome to Saurabh Chalke's home on the internet!<br /><br />I'm a fervent cypherpunk who once danced with the wolves of Wall Street at Morgan Stanley. Now, as the Co-founder of <a href="https://thinkingballoon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Thinking Balloon</strong></a>, I'm chasing bigger skies. We’re building autonomous stratospheric platforms to revolutionize defense, science, and connectivity—think SpaceX for the stratosphere. My passions? The physics of flight, the elegance of AI-driven systems, the challenge of distributed networks, and the potential of atmospheric tech to change lives. Step into my world, where innovation meets impact, and every problem is just a launch away from a solution!
