This is a letter to my future self, a time capsule to open in 2030 to see how much of this wild vision I’ve pulled off. I’m inspired by Sam Altman’s [2014 blog post on AI](https://blog.samaltman.com/ai), written two years before he co-founded [OpenAI](https://openai.com) with deep conviction that artificial general intelligence was possible. Like Sam, I’m betting on a future that sounds a bit crazy today but feels inevitable if you squint. Here’s my take: autonomous systems will redefine defense, and in a decade, tanks, aircraft carriers, and infantry might be as outdated as cavalry charges. The future belongs to AI-driven defense systems running the show, starting with stratospheric platforms that could change everything.

## The Balloon That Broke the Camel’s Back

Let’s start with a story that’s equal parts absurd and revealing. In [2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Chinese_balloon_incident), a Chinese reconnaissance balloon, probably costing a few thousand dollars, drifted into US airspace. The Pentagon, not thrilled, scrambled an [F-22 Raptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor) and an [AIM-9X Sidewinder missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-9_Sidewinder) to shoot it down. Total cost of the operation? Over half a million dollars. It was like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. Sure, it worked, but it showed how clunky our current defense toolkit can be against something as simple as a balloon.

But here’s the thing: that balloon was the dumbest version of this tech, the worst it’ll ever be. Compare that to Google’s [Project Loon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loon_(company)), one of the boldest moonshots ever. Loon aimed to beam internet to underserved regions like rural Africa using high-altitude balloons. It “failed” in that it didn’t become a commercial giant, but calling it a failure is like saying the Apollo program flopped because we don’t commute to the moon. Loon was a $500 million masterclass in stratospheric tech. They cracked station-keeping, keeping a swarm of balloons in place for months, not hours, by leveraging weather modeling and wind data. With recent leaps in atmospheric modeling (like Google’s [GraphCast](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/)), driving a fleet of these “atmospheric satellites” is getting cheaper than a Netflix subscription.

Loon’s dual-balloon system, using helium for lift and clever altitude control, was a great start. We’re planning something even better, miniaturized next-gen designs that make their setup look like a Model T. But they nailed the fundamentals, and we’re building on their work.

## Beyond the Battlefield: Why This Matters

Enough about military applications (though the dual-use potential is why our startup is staying quiet for now). What gets me excited is the chance to impact millions of lives through science and earth monitoring. These atmospheric satellites aren’t just defense tools; they’re game-changers for humanity. Unlike traditional satellites, which capture a region once a day, or drones, which run out of juice after a few hours, our platforms loiter in the stratosphere for weeks, offering high-resolution, persistent coverage at a fraction of the cost.

Imagine the possibilities:
- **Hyperspectral imaging** for precision agriculture, helping farmers optimize crops.
- **Greenhouse gas and VOC monitoring**, holding oil companies accountable for emissions.
- **Geoengineering** to fight [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) by working with the upper atmosphere.
- **Air quality tracking** to protect public health.
- **Disaster management**, providing real-time data for recovery.
- **High-speed internet relays**, connecting underserved regions to the digital world.

The real magic? These systems have network effects. One balloon is neat; a constellation of thousands, autonomously crisscrossing the globe for months, is a revolution. The more we deploy, the better the data, the smarter the system, the bigger the impact. Think [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com), but for the stratosphere.

## Chalke Industries: A Family Affair

Our startup, [Chalke Industries](https://chalkeindustries.com) (check out the website for some more info), is under wraps for now, like a dish still cooking. We’ll go public soon with fundraising details, but unlike my other projects, this one won’t be open source. The dual-use nature means we’re keeping things close to avoid misuse by folks with less-than-noble intentions.

Naming it “Chalke” wasn’t my first choice. I wanted “Vyom,” Sanskrit for sky, partly because it nods to [*Captain Vyom*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Vyom), a gloriously cheesy Indian sci-fi show from my childhood, and partly because using my family name felt a bit self-absorbed. But my co-founder, my brother Rushabh, who’s sharper at business and people than I’ll ever be, convinced me. He noted that defense giants like [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com), [Raytheon](https://www.rtx.com), and [Dassault](https://www.dassault-aviation.com) wear their family names proudly. A name ties the tech to people you can trust, someone accountable. Plus, it’s a subtle nod to [Stark Industries](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Stark_Industries), which is undeniably cool. So, Chalke it is.

## A Nod to the Future (and a Call to Arms)

If you’re still here, thanks for sticking with me. In five years, I’ll look back to see if we’ve made this atmospheric satellite constellation real or at least gotten close.

If you’re as pumped about this as I am, we’re hiring ambitious engineers in aerospace, electronics, and materials science at [Chalke Industries](https://chalkeindustries.com). This could be the most meaningful thing you work on. If we get it right, it might be one of India’s greatest engineering feats, a multi-billion-dollar exit that’s not even in my top ten goals. I’m not here to chase billions; I’m here to solve hard problems. But as [David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch) says, “All evils are due to insufficient knowledge.” Capitalism’s a tool, and if a few billion bucks let us reinvest in big scientific swings, that’s a net positive.

Here’s to building the stratosphere’s SpaceX and not messing it up.
