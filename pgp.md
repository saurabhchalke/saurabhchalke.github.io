### Reconquer Your Privacy

> "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."
> â€“ Edward Snowden

Encryption safeguards your privacy and thwarts bulk surveillance systems. [PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy), developed by Phil Zimmermann in 1991, is a key tool Snowden used against the NSA. It encrypts emails, texts, files, and more, ensuring secure communication.
